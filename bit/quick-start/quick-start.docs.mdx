description: A QuickStart component to use for creating QuickStarts .

import { QuickStart } from './quick-start';

This is a quickStart template that can be used to create a new quickStart for the bit.dev website. Here are a few examples of quickStarts built using this component:

1. [Wiki-Quick-Start](https://bit.dev/docs/quick-start)
2. [Design-System-Quick-Start](https://bit.dev/docs/quick-start/design)
3. [Analytics-Quick-Start](https://bit.dev/docs/quick-start/analytics)

#### What is a quickStart

A quickStart is a simple tutorial, explaining to new Bit users how to install Bit, create their first workspace, collaborate with Bit and build a specific component.
The quickStart component already has the installation guide etc., and you need to add the explanation of how to **build a specific component**.
We call this the _'mainComponent'_, and this example component is meant to explain a specific subject in Bit.

In order to create your own quick start, first you need to create and export the example component - the _'mainComponent'_ that you will be teaching the readers how to bulid in this tutorial.
Keep it simple and try to demonstrate one thing Bit can do, to avoid overcomplication and long tutorials.
Once you have the _'mainComponent'_ we can get started with creating the quickStart!

#### Building your quickSart

1. Add (optional) custom text - you can add all or some of these, keep it short, and explain why building this specific _'mainComponent'_ with Bit is a good idea:

- _'intro'_- there is a default intro if you don't add this text yourself.
- _'ending'_ - after the component showcase
- _'before-thinking'_ - before the component breakdown

2. Add the _'components'_ - the list of components that compose the _'mainComponent'_ (we recommend to have 3 to 6 components that are the important ones, so it doesn't get too crowded).

3. Add explanations before each of the components - what is their responsibility and functionality.
   This part gets added inside the _'components'_ array:

```js
const components = [
  {
    id: 'teambit.design/examples/sample-app',
    intro: <div>Add text about this component here</div>,
  },
  {
    id: 'teambit.design/ui/heading',
    intro: <div>Add text about this component here</div>,
  },
];
```

### Using the quickStart component:

```js
// Add all of your text as a string, an element or import it from an mdx file.
const components = [
  {
    id: 'teambit.design/examples/sample-app',
    intro: <div>Add intro text here</div>,
  },
  {
    id: 'teambit.design/ui/heading',
    intro: <div>Add intro text here</div>,
  },
];

const id = ComponentID.fromString('teambit.design/examples/sample-app');

<QuickStart
  intro={'Add your introduction here'}
  ending={'Add your text after the component showcase'}
  beforeThinking={'Add text after the component cards'}
  name="Name-of-your-quickStart"
  // id and main Component - The component you are teaching people to build. This will appear in the component showcase
  // at the top of the quick start, and this is usually also the first component in the
  // component-thinking-process (The breakdown of the components in the tutorial):
  id={id}
  mainComponent={<SampleApp />}
  // The components in the component breakdown at the end of the tutorial:
  components={components}
/>;
```
