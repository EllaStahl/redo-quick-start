description: A QuickStart component to use for creating QuickStarts .
---

import { QuickStart } from './quick-start';

This is a a quickStart template that can be used to create a new quickStart for the bit.dev website. Here are a few examples of QuickStarts built using this component:

1. [Wiki-Quick_start](https://bit.dev/docs/quick-start)
2. [Design-System-Quick_start](https://bit.dev/docs/quick-start/design)
3. [Analytics-Quick-Start](https://bit.dev/docs/quick-start/analytics)

In order to create your own quick start, first you need to create and export the example component - the mainComponent that you will be teaching how to bulid in this tutorial.
Once you have the mainComponent we can get started with creating the quickstart!

You will need to:

1. Add the 'components' - the list of components that compose the mainComponent (pick 3 to 6 components that are the important ones).
2. Add custom text : an 'intro', 'ending' (after the component showcase), and 'before-thinking' (before the component breakdown).
3. Add explanations befor each of the components - what is their responsibility and functionality.

### Using the component:

```js
// Add all of your text as a string, an element or import it from an mdx file.

<QuickStart
  intro={'Add your introduction here'}
  ending={'Add your text after the component showcase'}
  beforeThinking={'Add text after the component cards'}
  name="Name-of-your-quickStart"
  // id and main Component - The component you are teaching people to build. This will appear in the component showcase
  // at the top of the quick start, and this is usually also the first component in the
  // component-thinking-process (The breakdown of the components in the tutorial):
  id={id}
  mainComponent={<SampleApp />}
  // The components in the component breakdown at the end of the tutorial:
  components={components}
/>
```
